# stackoverflow
An R package for snippets from stackoverflow

When we want to use a function from stack overflow, add it here. It's cleaner,
gives credit where credit is due, and is better for lawyers if it's seperate.

## Installation

Using R 3.3.1 or greater:

    install.packages("https://github.com/nfultz/stackoverflow/releases/download/v0.1.2/stackoverflow_0.1.2.tar.gz")
